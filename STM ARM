STM IS A ARM BASED 32-bit MICRO CONTROLLER.
it harvard Architecture.
So  stm32 is mcus built on  arm cortex processor.
The stm32 is having the processores like cortex M0, M0+ , M3 ,M4 , M7
IS HAS THE MEMOERY FROM K BYTES TO M BYTES FLASH MEMORY FOR CODES.
OUR  STM32F4XX SERIES BOARD IS BASED ON ARM CORTEX M4.

FLASH 512 KB AND SRAM 128KB 

FLASH MEM - IS USED FOR PROGRM CODE . EACH BLOCK CAN BE INDEPENDENTLY EARSED AND WRITTEN TOO. VARIOUS ARM CHIPS HAVE VARIOUS TYPES OF SIZE OF FLASH MEM.
 
SRAM
====
SRAM IS USED FOR STORE THE VARIABLES , SCARCTH PAD AND STACK. 
ITS STARTING ADDRESS IS 0x20000000.
ADDRESS CAN BR USED FOR A PORTION OF SRAM TO ALLOW THE INDIVIDUAL BIT-ACCESS. THIS IS CALLED "BIT-BANDING".
 
 THE PERIPHERALS SUCH AS GPIO, TIMERS AND ADC ETC ARE MAPPED TO THE STARTING ADDRESS OF 0x40000000.
 
STM32F446RE = STM32 IS A PRODUCT FAMILY  
F IS A FAMILY PRODUCT TYPE 
446 IS A  DEVICE TYPE
RE IS INDICATING R MEANS IT HAS 64 PINS AND E MEANS IT HAS 512KB OF MEMORY ON FLASH MEMORY.

GPIO
====
WHILE MEMORY HOLDS CODE AND DATA FOR THE CPU TO PROCESS , THE I/P PORTS ARE USED BY THE CPU TO ACCESS INPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICES.

2 TYPES OF I/O : 

GPIO: USED FOR THE INTERFACING THE DEVICES LIKE LED'S, SWITHCES , LCD , KEYPADS ETC.

SPIO: THESE ARE HAVING DESINATED FUNCTIONS LIKE ADC ,TIMERS , UART , I2C , ETC. LIKE WHICH IS ALREADY DESIGNATED THE FUNCTIONS OF THIER PROTOCALS.

I/P PINS:
=== ==== 
IN STM32 THERE ARE PORTS NAMED WITH ALPHABETS A,B,C,D,E,F,G, AND H.
EACH PORT HAVING 16 PORTS AND PORTS ARE LIKE PA0- PA15 , PB0-PB15 LIKE THAT OTHER PORTS ARE.
IT IS NOT SURE FOR EVERY PIN IS CONNECTED TO THE CHIP, SOME PORTS IS CONNECTED AND SOME IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE CHIP.

GPIO Registers Address
==== ========= ======
IN ARM THEY ARE TWO BUSES : 

APB(Advance Pheriphal Bus): It is designed for the lower speed and lower power consumption memory and pheripherals.

AHB(Advance HighPeriformance Bus): is it designed to interface memory and fast I/Os directly connected to the CPU.

The AHB bus is much faster than APB. because,The AHB allows one clock cycle access to the memory and fast peripherals without any wait state. where apb bus is taking minimum 2 clock cycles.
